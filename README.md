# si
This is a small GIF generator using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

### How to build
Create a `gifs` directory at the root of the repository and put in some GIFs.
Then run `go build` (or `make`) to build the executable. You can also run `go install` to install the executable in your `$GOPATH/bin`.

Now you can just run `si your text` to caption a random GIF with your text.

That's it.
